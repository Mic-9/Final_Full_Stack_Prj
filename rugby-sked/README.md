# RugbySked

A web application that allows users to view rugby matches and save their favorite games after registration. Authentication and user-specific features are handled with **Laravel Breeze** and **Inertia + React**.

## Features

-   **Public Match Listing**: View all upcoming and concluded rugby matches.
-   **User Authentication**: Secure registration, login, and logout.
-   **Save Favorite Matches**: Registered users can mark matches as favorites.
-   **User Dashboard**: View all saved matches in a personal dashboard.
-   **Filters**: Filter matches by category (men/women/U20), status (scheduled/concluded), date and team name.

## Built With

-   [PHP](https://www.php.net/)
-   [Laravel Breeze](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/starter-kits#breeze)
-   [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/)
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/)
-   [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
-   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

> **Note on Inertia**: In this project we use Inertia.js to handle data exchange between Laravel and React. Inertia acts as a modern solution for passing data to React components, simplifying authentication and session management. This approach achieves the same goal of dynamic frontend-backend communication in a secure and efficient way.
